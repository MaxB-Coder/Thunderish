Overview: Thunderish is a clean and simple weather app that uses the Open-Meteo weather API (https://open-meteo.com/) and the Geoapify places API (https://www.geoapify.com/) to facilitate lookup of the current weather and 5-day forecast for a search location.

Inspiration: The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, Weather Underground

Objectives:

- Develop a responsive web application for displaying weather data.
- Implement integration with a weather data API to fetch forecast information.
