You now have free access to the following data:
- 15 Basic Parameters (see also: Parameter List Basic API Package): temperature (hourly, min and max), wind (speed, gusts, and direction), air pressure (mean air pressure at sea level), precipitation (hourly and daily), weather symbols (hourly and daily), UV index, sunrise and sunset.
- 500 queries/day

How to start?
You can start querying data immediately. You can find information on how to use the API in our introductory videos and in our documentation.

If you would like to expand your access to be able to use even more data and parameters, we offer you the opportunity to configure an individual business package together with us.
With a business package, you have the option of obtaining any number of queries per day as well as using additional features including historical data, climate data, industry-specific parameters, polygons, polylines (routes) or area queries. Interested?
